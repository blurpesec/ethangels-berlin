<h1>About</h1>

<p>ETH Angels is part of the worldwide ETH Anti Phishing Group. We are developing a website for people to easily report crypto scams into a friendly, single point of contact.</p>
<p>Verified scam and phishing data will then be propogated to organisations including MetaMask, MyEtherWallet, ETH Address Lookup and EtherScam DB.</p>
<p>This will reduce the current need for people to report scams to multiple points of contact (or give up because it's too darn difficult) and also helps avoid duplication in the scam verification process for these organisations.</p>

<h2>We are creating a clean, simple UI where people can…</h2>

<ul>
    <li>Report a scam</li>
    <li>View / search / filter scams</li>
</ul>

<h2>And where ETH Angels can…</h2>

<ul>
    <li>Triage incoming scams</li>
    <li>Provide data and mark a scam as verified or a false positive</li>
    <li>View / search / filter scams</li>
</ul>
