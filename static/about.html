<h1>About</h1>

<p>ETH Angels is part of the worldwide ETH Anti Phishing Group and we are developing a website for people to report crypto scams into a single point of contact.</p>
<p>Verified scam and phishing data will then be propogated to organisations including MetaMask, MyEtherWallet, ETH Address Lookup and EtherScam DB.</p>
<p>This will reduce the current need for people to report scams to multiple points of contact and also helps avoid duplication in the scam verification process for these organisations.</p>

<h2>We want to create a clean, simple UI where people can:</h2>

<ul>
    <li>Report a scam</li>
    <li>View / search / filter scams</li>
</ul>

<h2>And where ETHangels can:</h2>

<ul>
    <li>Triage incoming scams</li>
    <li>Provide data and mark a scam as verified or a false positive</li>
    <li>View / search / filter scams</li>
</ul>
